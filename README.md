# CS207 Sem2 Cryptography 

### Road Map
Here is how far we are through the project, and how far we still have to go.

##### Sprint One 
+ ~~As a player I want to be able to generate a cryptogram so I can play it~~ 

+ ~~As a player I want to be able to enter a letter so I can solve the cryptogram~~

+ ~~As a player I want to be able to undo a letter so I can play the cryptogram~~

Still some bugs in this stage but it might be close enough for the purposes of the task.


##### Sprint Two
+ As a player I want to be able to save a cryptogram so I can play it at another time

+ As a player I want to be able to load a cryptogram so I can continue a game I was previously playing

+ As a player I want to store my player name so the software can track my game play statistics
     + test

+ As a player I want the software to track the number of cryptograms I have successfully completed

+ As a player I want the software to track the number of cryptograms I have played so I can see how many games Iâ€™ve attempted

+ As a player I want the software to track the number of correct guesses I have made so I can see how accurate I am as a percentage of my total number of guesses 

+ As a player I want to load my details so I can track my game play statistics
