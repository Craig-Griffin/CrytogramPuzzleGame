\section{User Stories}
Epic: As a user, I want a cryptogram game so that I can so solve cryptogram puzzles and be scored on my performance.

\begin{itemize}
	

	
  

  \item As a player of the game, I want the ability to have an individual account within the app so that I can keep track of my own progess and compete on the leaderboard against other players.
  \item As a player of the game, I want the ability to be prompted with a hint that will fill in a correct letter within the puzzle. There should be no limit on the ammount of time I can use this feature.
  \item As a player of the game, I want the ability to give up and be shown the correct solution to the puzzle if it is too hard. 
  \item As a player of the game, I want the ability to save a games progress if I want to return to it at a later stage. 
  \item As a player of the game, I want to be prompted with an error if I have mapped my input to more than one letter.
  \item As a player of the game, I want to be able to see frequency 

\end{itemize}
