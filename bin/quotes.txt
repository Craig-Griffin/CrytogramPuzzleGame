No problem should ever have to be solved twice.
Within a computer natural language is unnatural.
Change the world by being yourself.
Everything you can imagine is real.
Die with memories, not dreams.
Fight till the last gasp.
Stay hungry. Stay foolish.
And so the adventure begins.
Whatever you are, be a good one.
The wisest mind has something yet to learn.
She believed she could, so she did.
Good things happen to those who hustle.
Whatever you do, do with all your might.
Don't dream your life, live your dream.
